Here is my project for my honor contract in CSE 110 at Arizona State University. Here is the original honors contract: 

CSE 101 Honors Project Proposal
Fitness & Weight Lifting Tracker

Overview:
This application will be a Java-based fitness and weightlifting tracking tool, designed for users to
monitor and analyze their progress throughout their fitness journey. With a focus on strength
training, the application lets users log and track their weightlifting performance over time,
providing insightful data to help them measure improvements in key lifts and overall strength. By
recording weightlifting data, users will have the ability to set personal records, identify their
progress, and stay motivated. Additionally, the app will monitor the user’s body weight over time,
helping users correlate changes in their physical condition with their lifting performance.

Scope:

1. Data Entry:
Users will have the ability to input detailed information about their weightlifting routines.
This includes recording data for fundamental exercises like the squat, bench press,
deadlift, hang clean, bicep curl, and others. For each exercise, users can log:

○ The amount of weight lifted

○ Number of sets and repetitions

○ The date of the workout

2. In addition to weightlifting data, users will also be able to input their body weight on the
same day they perform their workouts. This feature will provide a holistic view of their
fitness progress, allowing them to track how changes in body weight correlate with
strength gains.

3. Progress Tracking:
The application will automatically calculate percentage increases in the weight lifted for
each exercise over time, providing users with clear insights into their progress. Key
features include:

○ Percentage Increases: For each exercise, users will be able to see how much
they’ve improved from their initial lifts, with visualizations showing incremental
progress over time.

○ Personal Records: The app will store personal bests for each exercise and alert
users when new personal records are achieved.

○ Body Weight Tracking: Users will also be able to monitor changes in their body
weight over time, illustrating how their body weight has fluctuated in conjunction
with their fitness progress.

○ Comparative Analysis: Users will have the option to compare their current stats
with previous time periods (e.g., last lift or last 7 lifts, etc), providing a detailed
breakdown of how far they’ve come.
